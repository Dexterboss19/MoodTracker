# MoodTracker
My first android app is a basic mood tracking app. You can select between 10 moods and export the hole year as a jpeg to print it for a poster or share it or whatever.
# What I learned
- how to make an app
- how to use the layouts and put buttons on it
- how to change styles
- how to store a screenshot and update galery
- how to use Toast and NumberPicker
